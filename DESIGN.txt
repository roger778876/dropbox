Systems Level Programming - Final Project
Pickupbox by Cesar Mu & Alex Shevchenko

Description:
Dropbox is a popular cloud storage service used by millions. 
With Pickupbox, we wanted to recreate the main capabilities
of Dropbox, which are the abilities to upload to, store, and
download files from a central server. The central server can
keep track of multiple users, their personal files, and how
much storage space they have left.

User Interface:
The UI will be contained in the terminal. The user will first
provide login info, which will be verified by the server. The
user can then view their uploaded files through a simple file
browser/list. 

Technical Design:
Our project will heavily emphasize networking, pipes,
processes, and working with files. The central server and 
client must establish connections in order to upload and 
download files. There can also be multiple connections to
the server from different clients.
Cesar will work on the server-side processes and Alex will
work on the client-side.
We will most likely use arrays and perhaps some special structs.

Timeline:
1/6: Complete client file browser and basic server capabilities.
1/10: Finish client capabilities.
1/13: Finish server capabilities.
