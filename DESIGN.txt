Systems Level Programming - Final Project
Pickupbox by Cesar Mu & Alex Shevchenko

Description:
Dropbox is a popular cloud storage service used by millions. 
With Pickupbox, we wanted to recreate the main capabilities
of Dropbox, which are the abilities to upload to, store, and
download files from a central server. The central server can
keep track of multiple users, their personal files, and how
much storage space they have left.

User Interface:
The UI will be contained in the terminal. The user will first
provide login info, which will be verified by the server. The
user can then view their uploaded files through a simple file
browser ("ls"). 

Technical Design:
Our project will heavily emphasize networking, pipes,
processes, and working with files.
